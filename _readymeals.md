# Ready meals

The veggie ready meal section in Waitrose: without exception each
[product](images/readymeal_waitrose.jpg) has a plastic tray or panel. After a
while you just start seeing the plastic. Interestingly, though, the frozen
  section has plenty of choice in [simply packaged
  products](images/frozen-versus-fresh-products.jpg).
