# Plastic bags

It goes without saying: no plastic bags. Ever! People argue that they reuse
them, but how many times must they be reused to justify the decades they will be
hanging around afterwards? Must they be handed down to their children to offset
the manufacturing cost and environmental impact? Even official bags-for-life are
unlikely to last for the duration of your lifetime as claimed. But a cotton bag
will at least have a chance of decomposition when it has reached the end of its
useful life.

The answer can only be to not use plastic bags at all. See [this

Journal.

Various Twitter chat about plastic bags:

"@waitrose hi! Can beercan plastic rings go in with the plastic bag recycling?
And are they sorted manually when they leave the store?"

Waitrose @waitrose  Jan 3 2016:

"@deanturbo I'm afraid not - only plastic bags and film displaying the OPRL logo
can be recycled"

__Sainsbury's__

Dean Turbo @deanturbo  Jan 12 2016:

"@sainsburys Hi! Just noticed the 5p bags don't have the OPRL logo on them. Does
this mean they can't be recycled in store?"

Sainsbury's @sainsburys  Jan 12 2016:

"@deanturbo Hi Dean, they're made of recycled material and are recyclable, we'll
replace them free of charge if they become damaged." 

And here are some biodegradable bin bags from Infinity Foods. See
