# Plastic bags

It goes without saying: no plastic bags. Ever! People argue that they reuse
them, but how many times must they be reused to justify the decades they will be
hanging around afterwards? Why do they need a bag to keep all the plastic bags
in? Must they be handed down to their children to offset the manufacturing cost
and environmental impact? Even official bags-for-life are unlikely to last for
the duration of your lifetime as claimed. But a cotton bag will at least have a
chance of decomposition when it has reached the end of its useful life.

The answer can only be to not use plastic bags at all.

"@waitrose hi! Can beercan plastic rings go in with the plastic bag recycling?
And are they sorted manually when they leave the store?"

Waitrose @waitrose  Jan 3 2016:
"@deanturbo I'm afraid not - only plastic bags and film displaying the OPRL logo
can be recycled"

Dean Turbo @deanturbo  Jan 12 2016:
"@sainsburys Hi! Just noticed the 5p bags don't have the OPRL logo on them. Does
this mean they can't be recycled in store?"

Sainsbury's @sainsburys  Jan 12 2016:
"@deanturbo Hi Dean, they're made of recycled material and are recyclable, we'll
replace them free of charge if they become damaged."
