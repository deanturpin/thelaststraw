# Water

We're fortunate enough to have a good supply in Brighton so it's difficult to
justify bottled water. But it is of course treated. If you're concerned about
chlorination for general consumption or home baking then it can be left to stand
or boiled.

Infinity Foods stock *Life* refillable bottles if you'd rather have mineral
water: "which is sourced from springs on certified organic land in
Pembrokeshire."

For some bottle facts see [Ban the
Bottle](https://www.banthebottle.net/bottled-water-facts/). And see how
[Southern Water](https://www.southernwater.co.uk/water-treatment) treat what
comes out of our taps.
