# Changes

Changes I've made since meeting [Silo](http://www.silobrighton.com/)/[Trash is
for Tossers](http://www.trashisfortossers.com/)/[Alchemy
  Flow](https://www.facebook.com/AlchemyandFlow/) in 2014:

## Homemade food/drink
* Bread
* Kimchi/sauerkraut
* Milk kefir
* Soft cheese
* Home brew beer and wine

## Packaging
* Upcycled glasses by bottle cutting ([Kinkajou](http://www.bottlecutting.com/))
* Buying loose where possible ([hisBe](http://hisbe.co.uk/))
* Refusing products with non-recyclable packaging
* Stopped buying energy gels/sports supplements
* Keep a zero waste pot at work

## Foraging
* Interest in mushrooms (not confident enough to eat them yet)
* Gathering easy plants (herbs, wild garlic)
