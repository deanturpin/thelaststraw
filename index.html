<h1 id="bread">Bread</h1>
<p>Shop bought bread can really only come from a proper baker. In this case it's chewy white from Real Pâtisserie.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/bread_real_patisserie.jpg" />

</div>
<p>You can also buy Real Pâtisserie bread from Taj but it mostly comes in perforated plastic bags. Apart from the baguettes!</p>
<p>At a push you could buy buns from Waitrose and put them in the plain paper bags from the mushroom section rather than those with the plastic panel.</p>

<p>As an aside: all three look like they're tied shut. But the Heath and Heather also appear to be thermally sealed suggesting a small quantity of plastic in the paper mix.</p>
<h2 id="newspapers">Newspapers</h2>
<p>In the week newspapers are OK but inexplicably at the weekend the food/environment pullouts come in a plastic bag.</p>
<h1 id="fermentation">Fermentation</h1>
<p>Fermentation is not readily practiced by much of society but a great skill and will get you on the road to preserving things when there’s an abundance.</p>
<p>All these recipes use a percentage of salt. If 1.6% salt is required, 1000g of veg would need 16g of salt. But you should always taste the raw mix before bottling.</p>
<h2 id="basic-principles-of-fermented-cabbage">Basic principles of fermented cabbage</h2>
<p>Shop bought fermented goods are pretty pricey considering it's mostly cabbage. But it's really easy to get involved.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/kimchi1.jpg" />

</div>
<p>There's plenty of shop-bought kimchi in Brighton but very few in eco-friendly packaging. So why not make your own?</p>
<ul>
<li>100% red cabbage (loose, Infinity Foods)</li>
<li>25% wild garlic (wild, The Downs)</li>
<li>1.6% salt</li>
<li>1% red chilli (loose, Taj)</li>
</ul>
<p>Chop everything and mix in the salt. Crush with your hands to get the juices flowing (if it's a particularly tough cabbage you might need to use a pestle). Leave for ten minutes and repeat until there's a good amount of liquid in the bottom of the bowl.</p>
<p>Pack into a glass jar leaving about 20% expansion space and close the lid.</p>
<p>Keep out of the sunlight, it should start to bubble by day two. Taste it after a week. Is it delicious? If so, eat on homemade bread with aioli.</p>
<p>The flavour profile evolves over the course of a few weeks. If you manage to not eat it all you'll notice the taste drops off after a few weeks. If you really like the taste on a certain day move it to the fridge to slow it down.</p>
<p><img src="images/kimchi2.jpg" /> <img src="images/kimchi4.jpg" /></p>
<h2 id="fermented-salsa">Fermented salsa</h2>
<p>A very quick ferment that goes with anything.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two large tomatoes, coarsely chopped</li>
<li>Half as much onion as toms, 5mm dice</li>
<li>Two garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
<li>A few radishes, finely sliced</li>
<li>One red chilli, finely sliced</li>
</ul>
<p>The denser the vegetable the finer it needs cutting.</p>
<p>Put it all into a mixing bowl on a scale, add 1.6% of the weight of the veg in salt. Mush it between your fingers until mixed and quite liquid. Add to a jar, almost to the brim, pop the lid on and leave in a dark cupboard for up to a week. You can put it in a fridge if you like but the acidity should stop anything untoward occurring.</p>

<p>What's the best way to assess your plastic usage? Keep all of it.</p>
<p>Pledge to keep everything that is neither biodegradable nor recyclable in your area or office. A nice idea is to fill a jar and see how long it takes to fill it. It makes it all the more horrifying when you have to thrown it away in bulk, knowing that it's destined for the landfill.</p>
<p>It also makes you consider how much you want that bag of crisps knowing that the bag will be hanging around for decades. Conveniently, processed food usually comes in plastic so it makes it quite easy to avoid.</p>

<h1 id="plastic-bags">Plastic bags</h1>
<p>It goes without saying: no plastic bags. Ever! People argue that they reuse them, but how many times must they be reused to justify the decades they will be hanging around afterwards? Must they be handed down to their children to offset the manufacturing cost and environmental impact? Even official bags-for-life are unlikely to last for the duration of your lifetime as claimed. But a cotton bag will at least have a chance of decomposition when it has reached the end of its useful life.</p>
<p>The answer can only be to not use plastic bags at all. See <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122238422541876879">this article</a> in the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>It matters more if you have nobody to bequeath your plastic legacy.</p>

<p>Because you don't pay for it. Some things are prohibitively expensive to recycle and it's the consumer's job to refuse them.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-evolved-to-eat-meat">We are evolved to eat meat</h2>
<p>We have evolved <em>to be able</em> to eat animals. But does that mean it's good for us? And the planet? We could exist by eating only puffins but would we be healthy? Equally we can live perfectly happily on plants.</p>

<h2 id="i-eat-cows-but-eating-dogs-is-wrong">I eat cows but eating dogs is wrong</h2>
<p>What's acceptable to eat is, of course, completely arbitrary and driven by culture and religion.</p>
<p>Is it size? I don't think so: cows are good (unless you're Hindu), horses bad.</p>
<p>Is it intelligence? No, pigs are pretty smart.</p>
<p>Is it availability? Still no. Tigers bad, cod fine.</p>
<p>Is it cuteness? Absolutely not. We eat tonnes of lamb but foxes go untouched. (Bar the sport.)</p>
<h2 id="animals-are-there-for-us-to-eat">Animals are there for us to eat</h2>
<p>For survival, perhaps. But we grow plants to mass produce animals. If they're ours to eat why stop at one level of indirection? Why not fell forests to grow soy to raise cattle to rear crocodiles and then eat the crocodiles? Perhaps soy-fed cow crocs are tastier than grass-fed cattle?</p>

<ul>
<li>300g large oats</li>
<li>60g cacao nibs</li>
<li>60g dried goji berries</li>
<li>60g Silverspoon UK-grown caster sugar (paper bag)</li>
<li>60g Surrey honey</li>
<li>60g coconut oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine everything bar the berries (lest they burn), spread on a tray and cook at 200C for 8 minutes until brown (give it a stir around halfway through). I tend to chuck the berries on top when it comes out of the oven.</p>
<p>Actually you can chuck just about anything in and 60g seems a good proportion. I try not to make it too much about seeds but hemp and flax make an interesting addition. And if you're feeling flush you can omit the sugar and double up on the honey. I have tried olive oil when I've run out of coconut but it seems to catch (burn) very easily. Keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>Once you're happy with it check your Twitter for a while whilst it cools and transfer to an airtight container. This does keep it nice and crisp but we're all busy people and it will keep quite happily for a week covered with another baking tray.</p>
<p>Starting with 300g of oats makes one baking tray's worth. I tend to do two at once, the lower one stays in for the first eight minutes, stir and then I bring it to the top for a further four minutes.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/recycling-rubbish-and-street-cleaning/recycling-faqs">Brighton and Hove recycling FAQ</a></p>
<h2 id="bottle-recycling-in-brighton">Bottle recycling in Brighton</h2>
<p>Plastic bottles are the only plastics that Brighton &amp; Hove and many other local authorities currently recycle. Plastic bottles are mainly made from PET plastic (soft drinks and water bottles) and HDPE (milk and detergent bottles). There are already markets for plastic bottles as these can be recycled back into bottles or even fleeces!</p>
<p>There are several reasons why other plastics are not currently being recycled. These include: - There are not well developed and secure markets for all plastics. This means we may not be able to sell them on. - Even though some items such as food trays might be made from PET, they have different properties than the PET used to make bottles. This means we may not be able to process the material. - Plastics are used to make food trays and there is a concern that residents might place trays out for recycling that still contain food. If too much recycling becomes contaminated, it cannot be processed.</p>
<h2 id="lids">Lids</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes as the lids are made from different plastics so can contaminate the recycling. Please wash and squash your plastic bottles and put them in your recycling box without lids.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And come contradictory advice from Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BHCC_Cityclean (<span class="citation">@RecyclingRefuse</span>) Jan 7 2016, on communal recycling bins: If you're removing plastic lids from glass bottles, just unscrew the top and leave the ring attached to the bottle. You can cut them off if you really want to remove them. Plastic bottles can have them left on. Ryan.</p>

<p>What appears to be convenience for the shopper is really slight of hand by the mass producer. The producer enjoys longer shelf-life and protection during shipping and disposing of the packaging is passed on to the consumer.</p>
<h2 id="infinity-foods">Infinity Foods</h2>
<p>Firmly established vegetarian shop and organic advocate. Almost all of their veg is loose and they also have an excellent in-house bakery.</p>

<h2 id="taj">Taj</h2>
<p>All major supermarkets pack their greens in plastic so they're out. However, Taj offer bundles of spinach with no packaging. They also sell lots of herbs and spices that you often don't see loose.</p>

<p>You can repurpose the rubber bands from the spinach or make an awesome rubber band ball.</p>

<h1 id="water">Water</h1>
<p>We're fortunate enough to have a good supply in Brighton so it's difficult to justify bottled water. But it is of course treated. If you're concerned about chlorination for general consumption or home baking then it can be left to stand or boiled.</p>
<p>Infinity Foods stock <em>Life</em> refillable bottles if you'd rather have mineral water: &quot;which is sourced from springs on certified organic land in Pembrokeshire.&quot;</p>
<p>For some bottle facts see <a href="https://www.banthebottle.net/bottled-water-facts/">Ban the Bottle</a>. And see how <a href="https://www.southernwater.co.uk/water-treatment">Southern Water</a> treat what comes out of our taps.</p>
