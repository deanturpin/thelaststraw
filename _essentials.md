# Every day

## Oil
Coconut is a highly versatile oil for all cooking and in fact as moisturiser.
The 500g jars are a really useful size to reuse.

## Sugar
I used to use Billington's for bread making but why does it only come
wrapped in plastic? Old school Tate and Lyle it is.

Paper packaging, made in Britain: cannot argue with that.

Or just for kicks why not try coconut sugar?

## Salt
hisBe have pulled out the stops and are now enabling us to buy salt without also
buying bits of plastic to pour it with.

Alternatively, Tidman's might just save the day.

## Vegetable bouillon
Not something I'd even considered buying loose. hisBe are great.

## Honey

Spoilt for choice with honey. This was excellent from Surrey. So good I ate it
before I managed to take a photo.

A great selection of Payne's honey from Taj.

## Oats
hisBe's [loose oats](images/oats_hisbe.jpg) are very reasonably priced and of
course you can take your own vessel.

The first oats I found that didn't come in a plastic bag or a box with a plastic
panel were from [Pimhill Farm](images/oats_pimhill.jpg). But you can also try
[Wessex Mill](images/oats_wessexmill.jpg) who make great flour. There are a
couple of *mostly* plastic free options but look out for the tape seal at the
top of the packet.

## Fresh fruit
Why would you buy a net of tiny lemons from a supermarket when you could have
these beauties?

And finally some loose British apples from Taj!

Loose apples from Waitrose.

And loose French Pink Ladies from Sainsbury's Local. Expensive at Â£4+ per
kilo but still.

By contrast, organic apples from Waitrose. Each sealed in plastic and with a
choice of carbon footprint: Argentina, Chile or New Zealand.

## Tea
Check your current tea bags: how have they been sealed? Ideally we don't want
heat sealed bags as they contain a small quantity of plastic to bond the two
sides together. (We don't really want that in our tea either.)

There's good choice to be had from [Pukka](images/tea_pukka.jpg),
[Yogi](images/tea_yogi.jpg) and [Clipper](images/tea_clipper.jpg) but make sure
the outside of the box isn't wrapped in plastic and some also have an inner
plastic/foil packet (Twinnings).

## Newspapers
In the week newspapers are OK but inexplicably at the weekend the
food/environment pullouts come in a plastic bag.
