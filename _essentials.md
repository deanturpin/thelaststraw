# Every day ingredients

## Oil
Coconut is a highly versatile oil for all cooking and I also use it as a daily
moisturiser. The 500g jars are a really useful size to reuse.

## Sugar
I've used Billington's sugar for bread making in the past but why does it only
come wrapped in plastic? Old school [Tate and Lyle](images/sugar_tate.jpg) it
is. Or just for kicks why not try [coconut sugar](images/coconut_sugar.jpg)?

## Salt
hisBe have pulled out the stops and are now enabling us to buy
[salt](images/salt_hisbe.jpg)without also buying bits of plastic to pour it
with. Alternatively, you might try
[Tidman's](http://www.maldonsalt.co.uk/Products-Tidmans-Salt.html)

## Vegetable bouillon
Not something I'd even considered buying [loose](images/bouillon.jpg)
. hisBe are great.

## Honey
We're spoilt for choice with [honey](images/honey_surrey.jpg). Taj do a great
selection of the local [Payne's](images/honey_paynes.jpg) brand.

## Oats
hisBe's [loose oats](images/oats_hisbe.jpg) are very reasonably priced and of
course you can take your own vessel.

The first oats I found that didn't come in a plastic bag or a box with a plastic
panel were from [Pimhill Farm](images/oats_pimhill.jpg). But you can also try
[Wessex Mill](images/oats_wessexmill.jpg) who make great flour. There are a
couple of *mostly* plastic free options but look out for the tape seal at the
top of the packet.

## Tea
Check your current tea bags: how have they been sealed? Ideally we don't want
heat sealed bags as they contain a small quantity of plastic to bond the two
sides together. (We don't really want that in our tea either.)

There's good choice to be had from [Pukka](images/tea_pukka.jpg), and
[Clipper](images/tea_clipper.jpg) but make sure the outside of the box isn't
wrapped in plastic and some also have an inner plastic/foil packet (Twinnings).

## Newspapers
In the week newspapers are OK but inexplicably at the weekend the
food/environment pullouts come in a plastic bag.
