# Dining out

## Silo
Zero-waste restaurant/cafe/coffee. Not vegetarian but increasingly
plant-focused. Their in-house composter (which actually lives in the restaurant)
has such an appetite that they also take in waste from the surrounding
businesses.

## Burger Brothers
Burger specialists and they use reassuringly biodegradable boxes.
