## Six month review
(Inspired by Lauren Singer's zero waste jar.)

What's the best way to assess your plastic usage? Keep all of it.

Pledge to keep everything that is neither biodegradable nor recyclable in your
area or office. A nice idea is to fill a jar and see how long it takes to fill
it. It makes it all the more horrifying when you have to thrown it away in bulk,
knowing that it's destined for the landfill.

It also makes you consider how much you want that bag of crisps knowing that the
bag will be hanging around long after you've finished. Conveniently, processed
food usually comes in plastic so it makes it quite easy to avoid.
