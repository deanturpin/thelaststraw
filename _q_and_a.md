# Q&A

Disclaimer: I do actually eat animals but I think it's important to challenge
the arguments that justify it.

## Does zero waste matter if I don't have any children?
It matters more if you have nobody to bequeath your plastic legacy.

## Why doesn't the council recycle more?
Because you don't pay for it. Some things are prohibitively expensive to recycle
and it's the consumer's job to refuse them.

## We are evolved to eat meat
We have evolved *to be able* to eat animals. But does that mean it's good for
us? And the planet? We could exist by eating only puffins but would we be
healthy? Equally we can live perfectly happily on plants.

## Drinking cows' milk is unnatural
We can only consume our own species?

## I only eat animals that have been looked after
But does it matter? You're still slaughtering and eating them. Is this for your
benefit or the animal?

## I'm an animal lover [but I'm not a vegan]
How can you love animals and eat _any_ of them? You love consuming animals? You
love _some_ animals and eat the rest?

## I just want to help the animals [but I'm not a vegan]
You just want to help them into your belly! How can that not be hypocritical?
You just want to help *some* of the animals.

## I eat cows but eating dogs is wrong
What's acceptable to eat is, of course, completely arbitrary and driven by
culture and religion.

Is it size? I don't think so: cows are good (unless you're Hindu), horses bad.

Is it intelligence? No, pigs are pretty smart.

Is it availability? Still no. Tigers bad, cod fine.

Is it cuteness? Absolutely not. We eat tonnes of lamb but foxes go untouched.
(Bar the sport.)

## Animals are there for us to eat
For survival, perhaps. But we grow plants to feed mass produced animals. If
they're ours to eat why stop at one level of indirection? Why not fell forests
to grow soy to raise cattle to rear crocodiles and then eat the crocodiles?
Perhaps soy-fed cow crocs are tastier than grass-fed cattle?

Or we could just eat the soy and live perfectly healthy lives without killing
anything.
