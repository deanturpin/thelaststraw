What appears to be convenience for the shopper is really slight of hand by the
producer. The producer enjoys longer shelf-life and protection during shipping
but the responsibility of disposing of the packaging is passed on to the
consumer.

## Infinity Foods
Firmly established vegetarian shop and organic advocate. Almost all of their veg
is loose and they have an excellent in-house bakery. They also sell
biodegradable [toothbrushes](https://www.brushwithbamboo.com/) and [bin
bags](http://d2w.net).

## hiSbe Food CIC (how it Should be)

## Taj
All major supermarkets pack their greens in plastic but Taj offer bundles of

band ball.

Quite a nice illustration of the craziness of packaging! The same mushrooms
appear to be cheaper if you put them in a paper bag yourself. The paper bags can
of course also be used instead of the plastic and gel panel bags found through
the store.
