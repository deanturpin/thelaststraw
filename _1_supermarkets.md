What appears to be convenience for the shopper is really slight of hand by the
producer. The producer enjoys longer shelf-life and protection during shipping
but the responsibility of disposing of the packaging is passed on to the
consumer.

Ask yourself: is this purchase important enough to justify packaging that could
potentially be around for longer than I will?

# The future of supermarkets

And, ironically, how it use to be.

## Infinity Foods
Firmly established vegetarian shop and organic advocate. Almost all of their veg
is loose and they have an excellent in-house bakery. They also sell
biodegradable [toothbrushes](https://www.brushwithbamboo.com/) and [bin
bags](http://d2w.net).

## hiSbe Food CIC (how it Should be)
The go-to place for package-free shopping. A large choice of produce in
help-yourself hoppers, either take your own jars or use their paper bags. They
also sell a selection of "loose" cleaning products: washing up liquid, fabric
conditioner etc., and unpackaged soap bars.

Of particular note are ingredients such as [dry
coconut](images/coconut_hisbe.jpg), [cacao nibs](images/nibs_hisbe.jpg), olive
oil, [goji berries](images/goji_hisbe.jpg) and plain/milk/white [chocolate
buttons](images/chocolate_hisbe.jpg). They're only £10/Kg too, whereas Waitrose
charges up to 20/Kg for a 100g bar of Green and Blacks and you have to do
something with the packaging.

## Taj
All major supermarkets pack their greens in plastic but Taj offer bundles of
[spinach](images/spinach_taj.jpg) with no packaging bar a rubber band (which you
can repurpose or make into an awesome [rubber band ball](images/rubberband_ball.jpg).)
In fact they sell lots of herbs and [spices](images/lemongrass_taj.jpg) that you
often don't see loose. They also offer an interesting cheese alternative in a
reusable jar: labneh. It's a beautifully sour strained yoghurt that you can
spread on your toast. Taj has [loose apricots](images/apricots_taj.jpg) - a rare
source of loose dry fruit - and their Vatika soap bars come in a card box (no
inner plastic bag).

Taj hack: they don't offer paper bags unless you're buying a takeaway curry. But
the bread section has paper baguette bags hanging up so use them!

## Bluebird Tea Company
A fantastic selection of loose tea and tea-supping accoutrements. 10% discount
for bringing your own pot. Smells great in there.

## La Cave à Fromage
Specialist cheese shop and very supportive of the cause.

## The Food Shed
Another zero waste warrior Brighton Open Market. Lots of loose products
available and a 10% discount for using your own containers.

# Mainstream supermarkets

## Waitrose (Western Road)
First things first: make sure to take a [flask](images/waitrose_free_coffee)
for the free coffee.

Quite a nice illustration of the craziness of packaging: you can buy essential
white mushrooms prepackaged or loose. But the loose ones [work out
cheaper](images/waitrose_mushrooms.jpg)! So we're paying for the convenience of
not having to touch individual mushrooms? Similarly loose and plastic-wrapped
peppers are offered [side-by-side](images/peppers_waitrose.jpg) but we must
always choose the loose one. Often this means can't have exactly what you went
in for but the sooner we stop buying products *because* of the packaging the
sooner change will happen.

The paper bags can of course also be used instead of the plastic and gel panel
bags found throughout the store (notably the bread section).

The own-brand bulk-by [toilet paper](images/toiletroll_waitrose1.jpg) is
apparently from "FSC approved sources" and the wrapper can be returned to the
in-store bag recycling box.

Waitrose also offer a range of organic apples, sealed in plastic with a choice
of carbon footprint: Argentina, Chile or New Zealand.

## TK Maxx
TK is quite a good place to pick up [items](images/socks.jpg) with minimal
packaging. Although you do feel a bit "shop lifty" walking out with an unbagged
jacket. I guess it just takes time.
